# CE705 Introduction to Programming in Python Assignment

Had to write a classifier to group wines into a number of categories, based on similarity of their attributes.

Data is provided in the form of 178 wines, each wine in the form of 1x13 vectors.

Algorithm to implement is k-means clustering.
Had to classify wines into 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 different clusters.

An implementation using sklearn is also included for comparison.
